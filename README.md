Topic: The integration of augmented reality technology in shopping malls aims to improve the traditional shopping experience by allowing shoppers to virtually try on clothing and accessories in real time, offering accurate size and fit simulations, a diverse range of virtual products, and seamless integration with e-commerce platforms
Technologies: Any high-level programming languages (Used Python Here)

This Python code simulates an augmented reality shopping experience in a console-based environment. It allows users to view a list of available products, virtually try them on, add items to a shopping cart, and proceed to checkout. The products are described with their names, sizes, and any other additional details (if any). The script runs in a loop, offering options to display products, try them on, add them to the cart, or exit. This simple implementation serves as a foundation for integrating AR features into an E-commerce website.
